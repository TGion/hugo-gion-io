Repository for my [personal](https://gion.io) site.

Markdown based static site build with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Uses slightly modified [Codex](https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex) theme from with added functionality:
- copy code snippets to clipboard
- dark theme

Site is automatically deployed to my private server with GitHub Action when changes are pushed to the repository.
