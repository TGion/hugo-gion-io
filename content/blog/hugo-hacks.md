## Add a dark theme

Although many [Hugo themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/) have already implemented a dark mode, mine didn't. I can't possibly cover how to implement a dark mode for every theme but point you in the right direction. If you happen to use the [Codex theme](https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex), you can of course grab my darkened theme on [GitHub](https://github.com/TGion/hugo-gion-io).

Kudos goes to [lazerl0rd](https://github.com/lazerl0rd) for opening a pull request.
