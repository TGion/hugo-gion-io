This is a simple blog post to test Hugo features.

## First things first

This site is build upon the static page generator called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) while the theme is based on [Codex](https://github.com/jakewies/hugo-theme-codex).

Hugo claims to be the fastest static site generator. I don't have any comparison, but i can tell its not a sludge.

## Creating posts

In greatly simplyfing everything, posts in Hugo are divided into a description and a content part.

### Description

The description holds meta information for the page (e.g. title, keywords, tags, etc.).

For this page the description looks like this:

```
title: "Hello World"
date: 2022-09-19T14:36:00+02:00
draft: false
description: "Simple Hugo post to welcome everyone"
keywords: [tobias, gion, bsd, privacy, open source]
tags: [generic]
```

Those are just simple options. Depending on the theme you are using, many more can be available.

### Content

The content is obviously written in Markdown, which is such an awesome language created partly by [Aaron Swartz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aaron_Swartz) (RIP mate). There is an [cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) to help with the syntax, alltough in time it just works naturally.
